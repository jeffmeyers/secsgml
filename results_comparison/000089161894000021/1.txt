The Company develops and manufactures products that itmarkets and sells in the United States and more than 120 other countries. In itsfiscal quarter ended December 31, 1993, Apple generated 55% of its net salesfrom the United States and 45% from international markets. For informationconcerning factors that may affect Apple's future operating results andfinancial condition, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations -- Factors That May Affect Future Resultsand Financial Condition."      Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State ofCalifornia on January 3, 1977. The Company's principal executive offices arelocated at 20525 Mariani Avenue, Cupertino, California 95014 and its telephonenumber is (408) 996-1010. References in this Prospectus Supplement to "Apple" orthe "Company" mean Apple Computer, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, unlessthe context otherwise requires. COMPANY BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY      The Company's strategy is to expand its market share in the personalcomputing ("PC") industry while developing and expanding into new relatedbusinesses such as Personal Interactive Electronics and Apple Business Systems.See "Products and Businesses." Substantially all of the Company's net sales todate have been derived from the sale of personal computers and related softwareand peripherals. The Apple(R) Macintosh(R) and Apple Macintosh PowerBook(R)computers are the core product lines in this business. From Apple's introductionof the Apple Macintosh in January 1984 through the end of December 1993, morethan 12 million Macintosh personal computers have been shipped. As of the end ofcalendar 1993, there were more than 5,000 software applications for a widevariety of computing tasks (including word processing, statistical analysis,desktop publishing, database management, and three-dimensional modeling)available on the Macintosh platform.      According to independent PC market research data, the Company's unit shareof the worldwide PC market is estimated to be 10% in calendar 1993 compared with7% in calendar 1990. The Company believes that it must continue to increase itsmarket share in order to continue to be a successful participant in the PCindustry. The Company intends to pursue this objective by offering PC productsthat incorporate superior technologies at competitive prices. Concurrently, theCompany is working to reduce operating expenses throughout its operations andfocus its research and development investments on activities that it believeswill enhance its competitive position in the marketplace.      Average selling prices ("ASPs") for substantially all of the Company'spersonal computers have declined significantly over the course of the pastseveral quarters. For example, the ASP for the Macintosh LC II, one of theCompany's entry-level color computers, declined 44% in the first quarter offiscal 1994 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 1993. The ASP for theMacintosh Quadra(R) 950, the Company's highest-priced personal computer,declined 34% during the same period. The Company believes that these pricereductions have contributed to market share gains by the Company in the PCindustry during this period. Although ASPs for individual models of personalcomputers have declined significantly over the course of the past severalquarters, the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit declinedonly 12% in the first quarter of fiscal 1994 over the comparable period of 1993,reflecting a shift in user buying patterns to higher performance systems.      To offset declines in gross margins resulting from reduced ASPs and inresponse to continuing industrywide pricing pressures over the past severalquarters, the Company has implemented steps to reduce its operating expenses,both in amount and as a percentage of net sales. As a result of these steps,total operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 1994 were $527 million(21.4% of net sales) compared with $570 million (28.5% of net sales) in thefirst quarter of fiscal 1993. In the                                        S-3<PAGE>   4 third quarter of fiscal 1993, the Company initiated a restructuring of itsoperations as part of its ongoing efforts to lower its cost structure. Thisrestructuring included plans to terminate approximately 2,500 employees,relocate certain Company functions to lower-cost geographic locations, andeliminate certain projects and activities. The restructuring resulted in acharge of $321 million in the third quarter of fiscal 1993. See "Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations -- Year-to-Year Comparison -- Results of Operations -- OperatingExpenses."      The Company's inventory levels increased substantially during fiscal 1993from approximately $580 million at the end of fiscal 1992 to approximately $1.51billion at the end of fiscal 1993 in support of its expanded product line anddistribution channels and anticipated higher sales volumes. During the firstquarter of fiscal 1994, inventory levels declined by approximately $168 millionto approximately $1.34 billion, primarily as a result of improved inventorymanagement and increased sales resulting from pricing and promotional actions.The Company has also identified additional measures to enhance its management ofworking capital, including the implementation of long-term financingarrangements (such as the sale of the Notes offered hereby), and long-termmeasures designed to improve inventory management, such as increased emphasis ondesigning-in commonality of parts among products, increased use ofmanufacturing-on-demand techniques based on product orders rather thanforecasts, and greater rationalization of product offerings. See "Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."      As part of its goal to offer PC products that incorporate superiortechnology at competitive prices, the Company plans to begin introducingpersonal computers that are based on the PowerPC(R) architecture, a new ReducedInstruction Set Computing ("RISC") microprocessor design, in the first half ofcalendar 1994. These computers are expected to yield significant improvements inperformance and functionality compared with the Company's current products. See"Products and Businesses -- PowerPC-based Personal Computers."      The Company's strategy is also to use its position as a leading personalcomputer technology company to participate in emerging technology markets. Forexample, the Company believes that with its experience in the areas ofcommunications, mobile computing, and miniaturization, it is well positioned tobecome a leader in developing and marketing personal communications products,such as personal digital assistants ("PDAs"). See "Products andBusinesses -- Personal Interactive Electronics." PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES   PERSONAL COMPUTING PRODUCTS      Unlike most other companies in the PC industry, Apple develops and marketsboth personal computer hardware and the related operating system software. Thiscombination enables the Company to design well-integrated computer products thatprovide superior ease-of-use in both set-up and operation. According to aleading independent PC market research firm, ownership costs (including theinitial hardware and software costs; training and support; and the time a userspends learning new software applications) are significantly lower for Macintoshusers than for users of other leading PC platforms.      Apple's personal computers also feature "plug and play" capabilities. Forexample, every Macintosh computer includes built-in networking capabilities("AppleTalk(R)") which enable users to connect their Macintosh computerstogether in an AppleTalk network to share printers and files by plugging in onelow-cost cable without the need for any additional hardware or software.Macintosh computers can also be connected to other personal computers,minicomputers, and mainframes by means of other leading network environmentssuch as DECnet(TM), TCP/IP, SNA, APPC, 3270, and X.25.                                        S-4<PAGE>   5      The Company also markets a wide range of printers, monitors, scanners, andoperating system software. Additionally, the Company markets a variety ofinteroperability, networking, and communications products that enable theintegration of Macintosh systems into different computing environments such asMS/DOS(TM), Windows(TM), and UNIX(R). These products are supported by thousandsof independent hardware and software developers.      Apple's broad range of PC products enables the Company to reach a widevariety of market segments, including those in education; home; small, medium,and large business organizations; and local, state, and federal governmentorganizations. The Company's current line of PC products is based on theMotorola, Inc. ("Motorola") 68000-series of microprocessors and includes theClassic, LC, Performa, Quadra, and PowerBook families of Macintosh personalcomputers.   CURRENT PC PRODUCT FAMILIES      Macintosh Classic      The Classic family of personal computers offers a compact design and iswell-suited for commonly-performed functions such as word processing,spreadsheet modeling, database management, and personal finance. These productsare the Company's most affordable personal computer systems and are designed toappeal to first-time personal computer buyers.      Macintosh LC      The LC family of personal computers offers high performance and competitiveprices in a flexible, modular design. LC personal computers are well suited foreducation and business applications such as color presentations andspreadsheets. LC products are also capable of running the Apple IIe applicationscurrently used by a large number of primary and secondary schools.      Macintosh Performa      The Macintosh Performa(TM) family of personal computers is designed toappeal to first-time personal computer buyers. These products feature all-in-onebox computing solutions, including software and hardware designed specificallywith home users in mind. Performa products also include in-home service andunlimited toll-free telephone support. The Performa family is distributedthrough a wide variety of retail outlets, including national mass merchandisers,such as Sears and Wal-Mart, and computer superstores (high volume retail storesthat specialize in high technology products or office equipment).      Macintosh Quadra      The Quadra family of personal computers includes the most powerful desktopproducts in the Macintosh line and is targeted at business and professionalusers. Quadra personal computers include a wide variety of built-in featuresthat make them well-suited for activities such as color publishing, multi-useraccounting, three-dimensional modeling, computer-aided design (CAD), andcomputer-aided engineering (CAE).      PowerBook      The PowerBook family of notebook personal computers is specificallydesigned for mobile computing needs. All PowerBook personal computers includethe capability to connect to Macintosh desktop personal computers and AppleTalknetworks and, therefore, to access files and services that are located remotely;they also offer the capability to transmit facsimiles. The PowerBook family hasbecome one of the most popular personal computer families in the industry. Inthe first year following their introduction in 1991, sales of PowerBook personalcomputers surpassed $1 billion. As of December 31, 1993, the Company had shippedmore than one million PowerBooks.                                        S-5<PAGE>   6   POWERPC-BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS      During the first half of calendar 1994, the Company plans to introduce itsfirst personal computers based on the PowerPC architecture, a new RISCmicroprocessor design. The PowerPC microprocessor family is a result of a jointdevelopment effort by Apple, International Business Machines Corporation("IBM"), and Motorola. Apple intends to use the PowerPC in its products forseveral strategic reasons, including the expected price/performance ratio andthe potential for PowerPC to become a common standard used by Apple, IBM andother industry leaders.      The Company's PowerPC-based products are expected to yield significantimprovements in price/performance and functionality compared with the Company'scurrent products (which are based on the Motorola 68000-series of ComplexInstruction Set Computing ("CISC") microprocessors). The Company believes thatthese expected improvements will provide the Company with opportunities toincrease the functionality of its operating system software platform and attractnew developers and customers to the Company's hardware platform.      The Company intends to provide most of its current installed base ofMacintosh CISC-based platform users a competitively-priced upgrade path to theCompany's PowerPC-based products. Further, the Company intends to incorporate inits PowerPC-based products an emulation capability that will allow them to runexisting CISC-based software. The Company's research and testing indicates thatthe vast majority of current Macintosh software applications will run on theCompany's PowerPC-based products in emulation mode with performance equivalentto the Company's existing high-end CISC-based products.      The Company expects a number of third-party developers to publish newversions of commonly-used software applications specifically designed for thePowerPC-based products ("native versions"). Apple expects that a number of thesenative versions will be made available by third-party developers when Appleintroduces its first PowerPC-based products in the first half of calendar 1994.These new native versions are expected to provide substantial improvements insystem performance.   APPLE BUSINESS SYSTEMS      In 1991, the Company established a division, now called Apple BusinessSystems, to focus on the client/server computing environments of largeorganizations. The objective of this division is to develop, distribute, andsupport hardware and software products that will operate in mixed computingenvironments as well as in the Macintosh environment.      During fiscal 1993, the Company introduced several competitively-priced,high-performance hardware and software products particularly suited for serverapplications. These products are currently designed to address the client/serverneeds of Macintosh-based computer network environments. Apple plans to expandits hardware and connectivity software product offerings to other leadingnetwork operating system environments with additional competitively-pricedclient and server products. Many of these product offerings are planned to bebased on the PowerPC microprocessor and operate in the UNIX environment.   PERSONAL INTERACTIVE ELECTRONICS      Apple's Personal Interactive Electronics division develops, licenses, andmarkets technologies, products, and services in the categories of PDAs,multimedia products, and on-line services. The Company believes that there areseveral trends emerging that can create significant business opportunities forcompanies that can market affordable, portable, easy-to-use personalcommunications products and services. These trends include the shift from analogto digital telecommunications technologies, the expansion of network capacity,and the increase in the use of digitally-compressed information.                                        S-6<PAGE>   7      The Company believes it has the opportunity to develop an attractive PDAbusiness by widely licensing its Newton(R) technology to a variety of hardwaremanufacturers, software application developers, and service and communicationsproviders. The Company believes this licensing strategy provides Apple thepotential to establish a leading architectural standard for PDAs. Establishmentof a leading standard could enable Apple to develop a business model whoserevenues and profits are generated, to a large extent, from the on-going usageby the individual user of a variety of information and data services. As ofDecember 31, 1993, Apple had entered into agreements to license Newtontechnology and resell Newton products with several major companies, includingKyushu Matsushita Electric Co., Sharp Corporation, Siemens/Rolm, Motorola, andAlcatel SEL.      On July 30, 1993, the Company introduced its first PDA product, the NewtonMessagePad(TM), a handheld communications assistant. This product has notcontributed materially to revenues to date. On January 5, 1994, the Companyannounced its plans for its new on-line service, eWorld(TM), which is intendedto exploit new business opportunities in the area of on-line electronicdistribution of information, messaging, and entertainment.   CLARIS      Claris Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, develops,publishes, and distributes software applications in a variety of establishedpersonal productivity categories (such as word processing, database management,and graphics) for Macintosh and Windows-based systems. Claris also publishes anddistributes software developed by independent developers through its ClarisClear Choice(TM) program. Claris products are distributed primarily throughindependent software resellers. DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS      Apple reaches the various market segments of the Personal Computer Divisionthrough two general channels of distribution: direct sales and Apple authorizedresellers. Apple authorized resellers currently represent Apple's single largestchannel and operate in every country in which Apple sells products.      The number and types of Apple authorized resellers have evolved in recentyears as customer buying patterns, Apple's market focus, and the economics ofdistribution, have changed. For example, the Macintosh Performa line iscurrently distributed in approximately 5,000 retail stores, including computersuperstores (high volume retail stores that specialize in high technologyproducts or office equipment) in the United States. Over 1,600 value-addedresellers (businesses that create and sell customized hardware and softwaresolutions) currently distribute Macintosh products in the United States. MARKETING AND MANUFACTURING      Products sold in the United States are manufactured primarily in theCompany's manufacturing facilities in Singapore and Fountain, Colorado, anddistributed from facilities in Sacramento, California and Chicago, Illinois. TheCompany has two international sales and marketing divisions. The Apple Europedivision, based in Paris, France, focuses on opportunities in Europe as well asparts of Africa and the Middle East. Products sold by the Europe division aremanufactured primarily in the Company's facilities in Cork, Ireland. The ApplePacific division, based in Cupertino, California, focuses on opportunities inAustralia, Canada, the Far East, Latin America, and Japan. Products sold by thePacific division are manufactured primarily in the Company's manufacturingfacilities in Singapore and Fountain, Colorado.      As of December 31, 1993, the Company had approximately 11,000 regularemployees and 2,000 persons working on a temporary or contractor basis.                                        S-7<PAGE>   8                                 USE OF PROCEEDS      The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notesoffered hereby (estimated to be $297,550,000) to reduce short-term indebtedness(comprised primarily of commercial paper borrowings bearing interest at ratesranging from 3.0% to 3.5% per annum).                                  CAPITALIZATION      The following table sets forth the consolidated capitalization of theCompany as ofDecember 31, 1993 and as adjusted to give effect to the sale by the Company ofthe Notes offered hereby and the application of the net proceeds therefrom (asif such sale and application of proceeds occurred on such date).

Total Macintosh computer unit sales increased 40% inthe first quarter of 1994 over the comparable period of 1993. This unit salesgrowth principally resulted from strong sales of the Company's newer productofferings within the LC, Performa and Quadra families of desktop personalcomputers and within the PowerBook family of notebook-sized personal computers.This unit growth was partially                                       S-11<PAGE>   12 offset by declining unit sales of certain of the Company's more establishedproducts and older product offerings. The average aggregate revenue perMacintosh computer unit declined 12% in the first quarter of 1994 over thecomparable period of 1993, primarily as a result of pricing actions undertakenby the Company in response to continuing industrywide pricing pressures and highlevels of inventory. Going forward, the Company anticipates continuedindustrywide competitive pricing and promotional actions.      International net sales grew 24% and domestic net sales grew 23% in thefirst quarter of 1994 over the comparable period of 1993. The increase ininternational net sales primarily reflected strong net sales growth in thePacific region. Despite generally weak economic conditions and competitivepressures in various European countries, net sales grew moderately in Europe.International net sales represented 45% of total net sales for the first quarterof 1994, unchanged from the corresponding period of 1993.      The Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its firstquarter, compared with other quarters in its fiscal year, due to demand for andcalendar year-end buying of some of its products. The Company does not, however,consider its business to be highly seasonal.      It is anticipated that a significant portion of the Company's futurerevenues will come from new products, especially personal computers based on thePowerPC family of microprocessors. However, there can be no assurance that thesenew products will receive favorable market acceptance, and the Company cannotdetermine the ultimate effect these products will have on its sales or resultsof operations. See "Factors That May Affect Future Results and FinancialCondition."      In general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on anas-needed basis due to the Company's distribution strategy, which is designed toexpedite the filling of orders. Resellers frequently change delivery schedulesand order rates depending on changing market conditions. Unfilled orders("backlog"), which are not necessarily legally binding, can be, and often are,canceled at will. The Company's backlog decreased to approximately $302 millionat January 19, 1994 from approximately $663 million at November 19, 1993, as theCompany's higher inventory levels provided greater product availability to meetreseller orders and delivery schedules.      In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at anyparticular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects.Because of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the Company'sbacklog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company'sfuture revenue or financial performance.      Gross Margin      Gross margin declined both in amount and as a percentage of net salesduring the first quarter of 1994 from the comparable period of 1993. The declinein gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily a result of pricingand promotional actions undertaken by the Company in response to industrywidepricing pressures (including the increasing price competition that the Companyis experiencing in the Japanese market) and high levels of inventory. Grossmargin was also adversely affected by increases in inventory valuation reservesassociated with the high levels of inventory, increased costs associated withproviding customers a wider variety of product configuration options, and aseasonal shift of product mix toward lower margin products.      Gross margin was affected somewhat adversely by changes in foreign currencyexchange rates as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain foreigncurrencies during the first quarter of 1994 compared with the correspondingperiod of 1993. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into accountchanges in exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results ofoperations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations inforeign currency exchange rates.                                       S-12<PAGE>   13      The Company anticipates that gross margins will remain under pressure andbelow historic levels worldwide due to a variety of factors, including continuedindustrywide pricing pressures, increased competition and compressed productcycles. The Company's gross margins could also be adversely affected byinventory valuation reserves that could result if anticipated unit sales growthprojections for new and current product offerings are not realized.

These expenditures decreased bothin amount and as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter of 1994 whencompared with the corresponding period of 1993. This decrease reflects theresults of the Company's restructuring actions aimed at reducing costs,including more focused product development expenditures.      The Company believes that continued investments in research and developmentare critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplaceand are directly related to continued, timely development of new and enhancedproducts. However, in light of the Company's expectation of continued pressureon gross margin, the Company anticipates that research and developmentexpenditures will decrease in amount as the Company maintains its efforts tomanage operating expense growth relative to gross margin levels during 1994. <TABLE><CAPTION>                                                        FIRST QUARTER                FIRST QUARTER                                                            1994           CHANGE        1993                                                        -------------      ----      -------------<S>                                                     <C>                <C>       <C>Selling, general and administrative..................      $   375         -8.6%        $   410Percentage of net sales..............................        15.2%                        20.5%</TABLE>      Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount and as apercentage of net sales in the first quarter of 1994 when compared with thecorresponding period of 1993. This decrease was primarily a result of theCompany's ongoing efforts to manage operating expense growth relative to grossmargin levels, and also due to an increase in the level of net sales.      In the first three quarters of 1993, selling, general and administrativeexpenses increased sequentially in amount and as a percentage of net salesincreasing from 20.5% to 22.4%. In the fourth quarter of 1993 and the firstquarter of 1994, however, selling, general and administrative expenses as apercentage of net sales decreased to 17.7% and 15.2%, respectively, principallyas a result of the Company's restructuring actions initiated in the thirdquarter of 1993, which included a decrease in employee-related expenses. For adiscussion of the restructuring actions, see "Year-to-Year Comparison -- Resultsof Operations -- Operating Expenses." While no assurance can be given that therestructuring actions will be successful or that similar actions will not berequired in the future, the Company has already realized some cost-reductionbenefits, and expects to realize additional benefits in the future.      The Company will continue to face the challenge of managing selling,general and administrative expenses relative to gross margin levels,particularly in light of the Company's expectation of continued pressure ongross margin, and continued weak economic conditions worldwide. The Company'sobjective is to continue to reduce selling, general and administrative expensesas a percentage of net sales during 1994.

This decrease was primarily due to anon-recurring gain on the sale of certain of the Company's venture capitalinvestments in the first quarter of 1993, an increase in interest expense due tohigher commercial paper borrowing levels, and a decrease in interest income dueto lower interest rates and lower cash balances.

This change in accounting principle has been adopted on aprospective basis, and the financial statements of prior years have not beenrestated. The cumulative effect of the change was not material.      Under FAS 109, deferred income taxes reflect the future income tax effectsof temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilitiesfor financial reporting purposes and their tax basis. Prior to 1994, the Companyaccounted for income taxes under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 11, whichrecognized deferred taxes for the effect of timing differences between pre-taxaccounting income and taxable income.

Additions to the PowerBook family ofnotebook personal computers and the Performa family of desktop personalcomputers also contributed to net sales growth. This growth was partially offsetby declining unit sales of certain of the Company's more established productsand older product versions. Total Macintosh computer unit sales increased 32%over the prior year, compared with a 20% increase from 1991 to 1992. The averageaggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit declined 16% in 1993 compared with1992, primarily as a result of pricing actions undertaken by the Company inresponse to continuing industrywide pricing pressures and high inventory levels.      Growth in net sales in 1992 over 1991 reflected strong unit sales of theClassic II, LC II, and PowerBook and Quadra families of Macintosh computers, allof which were introduced in 1992. This growth was partially offset by decliningunit sales of certain of the Company's more established products and olderproduct versions. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unitdeclined slightly in 1992 when compared with 1991, primarily as a result of ashift in product mix towards the Company's PowerBook and entry-level products,coupled with pricing and promotional actions undertaken by the Company in 1992.      In 1993, domestic net sales increased 13% over the prior year, comparedwith an increase of 11% in 1992 over 1991. International net sales grew 12% from1992 to 1993, representing a slight decrease in growth rate compared with 13%growth from 1991 to 1992. International net sales represented 45% of net salesin 1993, 1992, and 1991.      Gross Margin      Gross margin as a percentage of net sales in 1993 continued to decline from1992 and 1991 levels. The gross margin percentage declined to 34.2% in 1993 from43.7% in 1992. The downward trend in gross margin as a percentage of net saleswas primarily a result of pricing and promotional actions undertaken by theCompany in response to industrywide competitive pricing pressures and higherlevels of inventory for certain products. Inventory valuation reserves recordedagainst certain products also contributed to the decline in gross margin as apercentage of net sales.      The decline in gross margin as a percentage of net sales from 47.5% in 1991to 43.7% in 1992 was primarily the result of industrywide competitive pressuresand associated pricing and promotional actions, partially offset by a shift inproduct mix towards the Company's PowerBook and Quadra products.                                       S-15<PAGE>   16      Gross margin was minimally affected by changes in foreign currency exchangerates in 1993 and in 1992.

These decreases reflect the Company's ongoing efforts to manageoperating expense growth relative to gross margin levels.      General and administrative expenses decreased in 1993 compared with 1992,primarily because of reduced employee-related expenses resulting from therestructuring actions taken in the third quarter of 1993. This decrease ingeneral and administrative expenses was offset slightly by an increase in salesand marketing expenses as a result of increases in product marketing andadvertising programs related to new product introductions and efforts toincrease product demand.      In 1992, selling expenses decreased in amount and as a percentage of netsales compared with 1991, primarily because of reduced sales programs andmarketing expenditures, as well as lower employee-related costs. Revenue growthalso contributed to the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of netsales. General and administrative expenses also decreased in amount and as apercentage of net sales in 1992 compared to 1991, primarily as a result of lowerlegal and employee-related costs. This decrease was offset slightly by anincrease in bad debt expense resulting from generally weak worldwide economicconditions. <TABLE><CAPTION>                                              1993       CHANGE       1992       CHANGE       1991                                             -------     -------     -------     -------     -------<S>                                          <C>         <C>         <C>         <C>         <C>     Restructuring costs and other.......    $   321          --          --          --     $   224     Percentage of net sales.............       4.0%                      --                    3.6%</TABLE>      In the third quarter of 1993, the Company initiated a plan to restructureits operations worldwide in order to address the competitive conditions in thePC industry, including increased market demand for lower-priced products. Therestructuring charge of $321 million included $162 million of estimatedemployee-related expenses and $159 million of estimated facilities, equipment,and other expenses associated with the planned consolidation of operations andrelocation and termination of operations and employees, including termination ofapproximately 2,500 employees, relocation of certain Company functions tolower-cost geographic locations, and elimination of certain projects andactivities.      The Company's 1993 restructuring plan consisted of a series of actions, themajority of which have been initiated. The remaining actions are expected to beinitiated during 1994. Spending associated with certain actions is expected toextend beyond the initiation of those actions. For example, lease payments undernoncancelable leases generally extend beyond the closing of the                                       S-16<PAGE>   17 facilities. Although plans are in place to carry out the remaining actions, someplans may be refined as the Company continues to identify the best means ofachieving reductions in its cost structure. The Company believes that therestructuring actions were necessary in light of competitive pressures on itsgross margins as a percentage of net sales and in light of generally weakeconomic conditions worldwide.      In 1991, the Company recorded a $197.5 million charge to operating expensesunder a plan to restructure its operations worldwide. The Company believed thatthe restructuring actions were necessary in light of its continued expectationof lower gross margins as a percentage of net sales and in light of generallyweak economic conditions worldwide. Also in 1991, the Company recorded a reservein the amount of $26.5 million in connection with certain trademark litigationfiled against it by Apple Corps Ltd. and Apple Corps S.A. in 1989, which amountwas paid in settlement of such litigation in 1992.

Workingcapital increased to approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 1993 from $1.8billion at September 24, 1993.      Operations generated net cash of $367 million during the first quarter of1994, compared with $400 million used during the fourth quarter of 1993. Thisimprovement was due primarily to decreases in inventory levels and accountsreceivable. Accounts receivable decreased by $134 million as a result ofimproved collections activity. Continued improvement in cash flow fromoperations for the remainder of 1994 will depend principally on the Company'sability to improve profit levels and the Company's continued aggressivemanagement of working capital, particularly in the area of inventory managementas the Company introduces its Power PC-based personal computers.      The Company's inventory levels increased sequentially each quarter duringfiscal 1993 from approximately $580 million at the end of fiscal 1992 toapproximately $1.51 billion at the end of fiscal 1993 in support of its expandedproduct line and distribution channels and anticipated higher sales volumes.These higher levels of inventory, in turn, resulted in increased levels ofshort-term borrowings. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 1994,inventory levels had declined by approximately $168 million and short-termborrowings had declined by $71 million from the fiscal 1993 year-end levels,primarily as a result of improved inventory management and increased salesresulting from pricing and promotional actions. The Company has also identifiedadditional measures to improve management of working capital, including theimplementation of long-term financing arrangements (such as the sale of theNotes offered hereby), and long-term measures designed to improve inventorymanagement, such as increased emphasis on designing-in commonality of partsamong products, increased use of manufacturing-on-demand based on product ordersrather than forecasts, and greater rationalization of product offerings.Although the Company believes that these measures will result in improvedinventory and working capital management during 1994, there can be no assurancethat these measures will be successful or that inventory reserves will not benecessary in future periods.      Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaledapproximately $24 million during the first quarter of 1994 compared with $47million during the first quarter of 1993. In both quarters, the purchases wereprimarily of manufacturing machinery and equipment and leasehold improvements.The Company anticipates that capital expenditures in 1994 will be slightly below1993 expenditures.      Short-term borrowings at December 31, 1993 were approximately $71 millionlower than at September 24, 1993. The Company's aggregate borrowings at December31, 1993 were approximately $752 million, comprised of approximately $527million short-term borrowings in the U.S. and                                       S-18<PAGE>   19 approximately $225 million of short-term borrowings overseas. Aggregateborrowings at September 24, 1993 were $823 million.      The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents,and short-term investments, net of short-term borrowings, declined to $69million at the end of 1993, compared with $1.25 billion and $744 million at theend of 1992 and 1991, respectively. Working capital was $1.8 billion at the endof 1993, compared with $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion at the end of 1992 and1991, respectively.      In 1993, $662 million of net cash was used for operations compared with$921 million of net cash generated by operations in 1992. This change resultedprimarily from a substantial increase in inventory levels; significant pricereductions taken in response to competitive pressures, which resulted in lowergross margin and net income despite higher net sales; and increases in accountsreceivable levels resulting from higher net sales coupled with slowercollections. These factors were offset slightly by increases in accruedrestructuring costs and accounts payable.      In 1992, net cash generated by operations increased compared with 1991,primarily as a result of increased net income and lower inventory levels, offsetsomewhat by a reduction in accrued restructuring costs. Higher sales resultingfrom strong demand for new products and price reductions and other salesincentive programs, coupled with a decrease in operating expenses, contributedto the increase in net income. Inventory levels decreased as a result of highersales levels and more effective inventory management.      Excluding short-term investments, net cash used for investments declined in1993 compared with 1992 and 1991 levels. Net cash used for the purchase ofproperty, plant and equipment totaled $213 million in 1993, and was primarilymade up of increases in land and buildings, manufacturing machinery andequipment, and leasehold improvements.      Net cash generated by financing activities increased in 1993 compared with1992 and 1991, mainly because of a significant increase in short-term borrowingsused for working capital needs. Net cash generated by financing activities in1993 was partially offset by the repurchase of approximately five million sharesof the Company's common stock in the open market under stock repurchaseprograms.      The Company expects that it will continue to incur short-and long-termborrowings from time to time to finance U.S. working capital needs and capitalexpenditures, because substantially all of the Company's cash, cash equivalents,and short-term investments is held by foreign subsidiaries, generally in U.S.dollar denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would besubject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the United States. TheCompany's financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability onamounts that may be repatriated.      The Company's short-term borrowings are principally under its commercialpaper program. From time to time, the Company also borrows to finance operationspursuant to short-term uncommitted bid-line arrangements with commercial banks.During the first quarter of 1994, the Company entered into a $500 millionunsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks to support itscommercial paper program. No borrowings have been made under this facility. Inaddition, Apple Japan, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, incurredshort-term yen-denominated borrowings aggregating the U.S. dollar equivalent ofapproximately $225 million from several Japanese banks.      On May 5, 1993, the Company filed an omnibus shelf registration statementwith the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of debt andother securities for an aggregate offering amount of $500 million. The $300million aggregate principal amount of Notes offered hereby represents the firsttakedown under this shelf registration statement. The Company believes that thisshelf registration provides it with additional financing flexibility to meetfuture funding requirements and to take advantage of attractive marketconditions.      The Company leases the majority of its facilities and certain of itsequipment under noncancelable operating leases. In 1993, rent expense underoperating leases was approximately $170                                       S-19<PAGE>   20 million. For additional information with respect to the Company's future leasecommitments, reference is made to the Note entitled "Commitments andContingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in theCompany's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24,1993, which is incorporated by reference in the accompanying Prospectus.      In January 1994, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company exercised itsoption to purchase for $51.9 million the remaining partnership interest in theCupertino Gateway Partners partnership, a general partnership, which owns theCompany's campus-type office facilities located in Cupertino, California (the"Campus"). As a result of this purchase, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiarynow owns 100% of the right, title, and interest in the Campus. This transactionwill be reflected in the Company's financial statements for the second quarterof 1994.      The Internal Revenue Service has asserted federal income tax deficienciesfor the years 1984 through 1988, which the Company is contesting. The Companybelieves the resolution of any tax liability for these proposed tax deficiencieswill occur over the course of the next several years. Although payment of anyassessment is not required until the end of such process, the Company elected tomake a prepayment in April 1991 for the years 1984 through 1986, and aprepayment in May 1993 for the years 1987 through 1988.      The Company believes that its balances of cash, cash equivalents, andshort-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, theproceeds of the sale of the Notes offered hereby, and other short-and long-termborrowing capabilities, will be sufficient to meet its operating cashrequirements in the foreseeable future. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION      During the first half of calendar year 1994, the Company plans to introduceits first Macintosh computers based on the new PowerPC family of RISCmicroprocessors. Accordingly, the Company's results of operations and financialcondition could be adversely affected if it is unable to successfully transitionits line of Macintosh personal computers and servers from the Motorola68000-series of microprocessors to the PowerPC microprocessor. The success ofthis transition will depend on the Company's ability to continue the salesmomentum of products based on the Motorola 68000-series of microprocessorsthrough the introduction of its PowerPC-based products, to successfully manageinventory levels of both product lines simultaneously, to gain market acceptanceof its PowerPC-based products, and to coordinate the timely development anddistribution of new versions of commonly-used software products specificallydesigned for its PowerPC-based products.      The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also beaffected by a number of other factors, including the Company's ability to:increase market share in its PC business while successfully expanding its newbusinesses and product offerings into other markets; broaden industry acceptanceof the Newton PDA product, including effectively licensing Newton technology andmarketing the related products and services; realize the anticipatedcost-reduction benefits associated with its restructuring plan initiated in thethird quarter of 1993; develop, manufacture, and sell its products profitably;reduce existing inventory levels and manage future inventory levels effectively.The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also beaffected by uncertainties relative to global economic conditions; the strengthof its distribution channels; industry factors; and the availability and cost ofcomponents.      The PC industry is highly volatile and continues to be characterized bydynamic customer demand patterns, rapid technological advances, frequentintroduction of new products and product enhancements, and industrywidecompetition resulting in aggressive pricing practices and downward pressure ongross margins. The Company's operating results and financial condition could beadversely affected should the Company be unable to: accurately anticipatecustomer demand; introduce new products on a timely basis; manage lead timesrequired to obtain components in order to be more responsive to short-termshifts in customer demand patterns; offer customers                                       S-20<PAGE>   21 competitive technologies while effectively managing the impact on inventorylevels and the potential for customer confusion created by productproliferation; effectively manage the impact on the Company of industrywidepricing pressures; or effectively implement and manage the competitive risksassociated with certain of the Company's collaboration agreements with othercompanies, such as the Company's agreements with IBM. The Company's results ofoperations and financial condition could also be adversely affected by inventoryvaluation reserves that could result if anticipated sales unit growthprojections for new and current product offerings are not realized.      A large portion of the Company's revenues in recent years has come from itsinternational operations. As a result, the Company's operating results andfinancial condition could be significantly affected by international factors,such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditionsin foreign markets in which the Company distributes its products. The Company'soperating strategy and pricing take into account changes in exchange rates overtime; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affectedin the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.      During the first quarter of 1994, the Company introduced several productsthat extend its entry-level, midrange and notebook computer offerings. Inaddition, the Company introduced several new or enhanced peripheral products.The success of these new products is dependent on a number of factors, includingmarket acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated withproduct transitions, and the Company's ability to reduce existing inventorylevels and manage future inventory levels in line with anticipated productdemand and to manufacture the products in appropriate quantities to meetanticipated demand. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimateeffect that these new products will have on its sales or results of operations.      The Company's products include certain components, such as microprocessorsmanufactured by Motorola, Inc. and monochrome active-matrix displaysmanufactured by Hosiden Corporation, that are currently available only fromsingle sources. Any availability limitations, interruptions in supplies, orprice increases of these and other components could adversely affect theCompany's business and financial results.      The majority of the Company's research and development activities, itscorporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are located nearmajor earthquake faults. The Company's operating results and financial conditioncould be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.      A number of uncertainties also exist regarding the marketing anddistribution of the Company's products. The Company's primary means ofdistribution is through third-party computer resellers and various education andconsumer channels. Although the Company has in place certain policies to limitconcentrations of credit risk, business and financial results could be adverselyaffected in the event that the generally weak financial condition of third-partycomputer resellers worsens. In addition, the Company is continuing its expansioninto new distribution channels, such as mass merchandise stores (such as Searsand Wal-Mart), consumer electronics outlets, and computer superstores, inresponse to changing industry practices and customer preferences. At this time,the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect of these or other futuredistribution expansion efforts on its future operating results.      Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting theCompany's operating results and financial condition, past financial performanceshould not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, andinvestors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends infuture periods.

Capitalized terms nototherwise defined herein or in the accompanying Prospectus have the meaningsgiven to them in the Indenture. GENERAL      The Notes will be issued under an Indenture dated as of February  , 1994(the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (insubstitution for Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, which has recentlyannounced the sale of substantially all of its domestic corporate trustbusiness) (the "Trustee"). The Notes will be limited to $          aggregateprincipal amount and will mature on                , 2004. The Notes will bearinterest at the rate of      % per annum from                , 1994, or from themost recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or providedfor, payable semiannually on                and                of each year,commencing                , 1994, to the persons in whose names the Notes (orany predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business on the               or                , as the case may be, next preceding suchInterest Payment Date.      The Notes will be unsecured general obligations of the Company that willrank on a parity with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of theCompany from time to time outstanding.      The defeasance and covenant defeasance provisions of the Indenturedescribed under the caption "Description of Securities -- Description of DebtSecurities -- Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance" in the accompanying Prospectuswill apply to the Notes.      The covenant provisions of the Indenture described under the caption"Description of Securities -- Description of Debt Securities -- CertainCovenants of the Company" in the accompanying Prospectus will apply to theNotes.      The Notes do not provide for any sinking fund. OPTIONAL REDEMPTION      The Notes will be redeemable, at the option of the Company, at any time inwhole or from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 and not more than 60days' notice mailed to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at his addressappearing in the Security Register, on any date prior to their Stated Maturityat a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interestto the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on therelevant Regular Record Date to receive interest due on an Interest Payment Datethat is on or prior to the Redemption Date) plus a Make-Whole Premium, if any(the "Redemption Price").      The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any Note (or portionthereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:      (i) the sum of the present value, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of:           (A) each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have              been payable on the Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed on              each Interest Payment Date occurring after the Redemption Date              (excluding any accrued interest for the period prior to the              Redemption Date); and           (B) the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have              been payable on the Stated Maturity of the Note (or portion              thereof) being redeemed;      over      (ii) the principal amount of the Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed.                                       S-22<PAGE>   23      The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause(i) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles offinancial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting theamount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each suchpayment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Dateat a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below).      For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium, "Treasury Yield" meansa rate of interest per annum (expressed on semi-annual bond equivalent yieldbasis) equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States TreasuryNotes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term toStated Maturity of the Notes, calculated to the nearest 1/12 of the year (the"Remaining Term"). The Treasury Yield will be determined as of the thirdbusiness day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.      The weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes will bedetermined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by theFederal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "H.15(sec. 19) Selected InterestRates" or successor publication (or, if such Statistical Release (or successorpublication) is no longer published or no longer contains the applicable data,to the most recently published issue of The Wall Street Journal (EasternEdition) that contains such data or, if the Wall Street Journal (EasternEdition) is no longer published or no longer contains such data, to any publiclyavailable source of such market data) (the "Applicable Source"). If theApplicable Source sets forth a weekly average yield for United States TreasuryNotes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, thenthe Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield. In all othercases, the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation, on astraight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United StatesTreasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than theRemaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constantmaturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forthin the Applicable Source). Any weekly average yields so calculated byinterpolation will be rounded to the nearest 1/100 of 1%, with any figure of1/200% or above being rounded upward.      If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will selectthe Notes to be redeemed pro rata or by lot. The Trustee may select forredemption Notes and portions of Notes in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiplesof $1,000, provided that if all of the Notes of a holder are to be redeemed, theentire outstanding amount of the Notes held by such Holder, even if not a wholemultiple of $1,000, will be redeemed. BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM      The Notes will be represented by one or more Global Notes (collectively,the "Global Note") registered in the name of a nominee of The Depository TrustCompany, as Depositary. The provisions set forth under "Description ofSecurities -- Description of Debt Securities -- Book-Entry System" in theaccompanying Prospectus will be applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, beneficialinterests in the Notes will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effectedonly through, records maintained by the Depositary and its participants. Exceptas described under "Description of Securities -- Description of DebtSecurities -- Book-Entry System" in the accompanying Prospectus, owners ofbeneficial interests in the Global Note will not be entitled to receive Notes indefinitive form and will not be considered Holders of Notes.      The Depositary has advised the Company and the Underwriters as follows: TheDepositary is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of theState of New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a "clearingcorporation" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a"clearing agency" registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, asamended. The Depositary was created to hold securities of its participants andto facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among itsparticipants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes inaccounts of the participants, thereby eliminating the need for                                       S-23<PAGE>   24 physical movement of securities certificates. The Depositary's participantsinclude securities brokers and dealers (including the Underwriters), banks,trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations, some ofwhom (and/or their representatives) own the Depositary. Access to theDepositary's book-entry system is also available to others such as banks,brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodialrelationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. The Depositaryagrees with and represents to its participants that it will administer itsbook-entry system in accordance with its rules and by-laws and requirements oflaw.      Payment of principal and interest and premium, if any, on the Notesregistered in the name of the Depositary's nominee will be made in same-dayfunds to the Depositary's nominee as the registered owner of the Global Note.Under the terms of the Indenture, the Company and the Trustee will treat thepersons in whose names the Notes are registered as the owners of such Notes forthe purpose of receiving payment of principal and interest and premium, if any,on such Notes and for all other purposes whatsoever. Therefore, neither theCompany, the Trustee nor any paying agent has any direct responsibility orliability for the payment of principal or interest or premium, if any, on theNotes to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Note. The Depositary hasadvised the Company and the Trustee that its current practice is, upon receiptof any payment of principal or interest or premium, if any, to immediatelycredit the accounts of the participants with such payment in amountsproportionate to their respective holdings in principal amount of beneficialinterests in the Global Note as shown in the records of the Depositary. Paymentsby participants and indirect participants to owners of beneficial interests inthe Global Note will be governed by standing instructions and customarypractices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customersin bearer form or registered in "street name," and will be the responsibility ofthe participants or indirect participants. SAME-DAY SETTLEMENT      Settlement for the Notes will be made by the Underwriters in same-dayfunds.      Secondary trading in long-term notes and debentures of corporate issuers isgenerally settled in clearing-house or next-day funds. In contrast, the Noteswill trade in the Depositary's Same-Day Funds Settlement System until maturity,and secondary market trading activity in the Notes will therefore be required bythe Depositary to settle in same-day funds. No assurance can be given as to theeffect, if any, of settlement in same-day funds on trading activity in theNotes. REGARDING THE TRUSTEE      The Trustee under the Indenture will be Citibank, N.A. (in substitution forMorgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, which has recently announced the saleof substantially all of its domestic corporate trust business). The Trusteecurrently provides certain banking and financial services to the Company,including acting as an agent and lender for the Company's $500 million unsecuredrevolving credit facility. The Trustee is also currently acting as agent underthe Company's commercial paper program. The Trustee may provide other bankingand financial services in the future. The Indenture contains limitations on theright of the Trustee, as a creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claimsin certain cases or to realize for its own account on certain property receivedin respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will bepermitted to engage in certain other transactions; however, if it acquires anyconflicting interest and there is a default under the Indenture, the Trusteemust eliminate such conflict or resign.
